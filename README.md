# AI-Learns-to-play-Snake

Welcome to Episode 1 of my brand-new series: AI Learns to Play Classic Games! 🚀
In this series, we train AI agents using Machine Learning & Reinforcement Learning to master some of our favorite childhood games like Snake, Flappy Bird, Tetris, Pong, and Chrome Dino.

👉 In today’s video, we’ll see how an AI agent learns Snake from scratch using Deep Q-Learning. At first, it struggles and makes funny mistakes, but after training… it becomes smarter than us humans! 🤯
